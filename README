Here is is, finally a GUI to the scheduler that also shows the liklihood of failure

You need the SchedSim executable file in your local directory to run. This is the guy that does all of the work

to run just type make, then ./schedSim.py

I am sure there are some requirements needed like PyQt4, matplotlib, etc
I used:
pip install python-matplotlib-qt4
pip install python-qt


You can hover over the labels to get more info on what each field does.
Issues:

Don't enter too many jobs, keep it under 300, otherwise it takes too long, also the "Dynamic" schedule doesn't do anything now.

Any and all feedback is great.
